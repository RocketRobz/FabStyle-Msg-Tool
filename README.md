# FabStyle-Msg-Tool
A tool for FabStyle `msgsec###.dat` message files

Place the DS version's `msgsec###.dat` files in the `DS` folder, and/or the 3DS version's `msgsec###.dat` files in the `3DS` folder. (Both folders go in the same location as the .exe file.)    
Then you can extract the messages from those files, as well as making new .dat files from the extracted message files.
